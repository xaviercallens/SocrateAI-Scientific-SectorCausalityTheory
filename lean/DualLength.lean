The dual length of a quantum fluid (design memo docs/designs/DUAL_SCALE_QUANTUM_FLUID.md; CLAIM-024).

For a fluid with excitation energy `ε(k)`, sound speed `c` and `hc := ħc`, define

    ℓ(k) := ε(k)² / (hc² k³).

`ℓ` is measurable: `ε` is what neutron scattering reports and `c` is the `k → 0` slope.
This file proves, for the Bogoliubov dispersion `ε² = (hc·k)² + (hc·k²/ks)²` with
`ks = 2mc/ħ`:

  * `dualLength_bogoliubov` : ℓ = 1/k + k/ks²  — the `R + α'/R` form, with `R = 1/k`, `α' = 1/ks²`;
  * `ell_dual_invariant`    : ℓ is invariant under the involution `k ↦ ks²/k`, which exchanges
                              the phonon and free-particle terms;
  * `ell_ge`, `ell_eq_iff`  : ℓ ≥ 2/ks, with equality exactly at the self-dual point `k = ks`;
  * `dualLength_phonon`, `dualLength_free` : the two limits are exactly `1/k` and `k/ks²`;
  * `not_bogoliubov_of_lt`  : a MEASURED ℓ below `2/ks` refutes the Bogoliubov form at that `k`.
    This is the lemma the He-II measurement uses (measured ℓ/(2/ks) = 0.047 at the roton).

NOT claimed: anything about string theory or T-duality (the shape is AM-GM on two positive terms);
anything about the real ⁴He dispersion, which is measured data, not a theorem; any dynamical statement.

/-! ## The bound restated on the static structure factor

Feynman's relation writes the excitation energy through the static structure factor `S(k)`:
`ε_F(k) = ħ²k²/(2mS(k))`, which in these variables is `hc·k²/(ks·S)` (the free-particle energy
divided by `S`). Feynman's argument is *variational*, so `ε ≤ ε_F` for the true dispersion;
that inequality is taken below as a hypothesis (it is physics input, not proved here).

The consequence is that the dual-scale bound is **equivalent to a bound on `S`**, and `S` is what a
diffraction experiment measures directly, without any dispersion measurement. -/

/-- Under Feynman's relation the dual length is `k/(ks² S²)`. -/

  unfold dualLength; field_simp

/-- **The dual-scale bound is a structure-factor bound.** `ℓ_F(k) ≥ 2/ks` exactly when
`S(k)² ≤ k/(2ks)`. A structure-factor peak above `√(k/(2ks))` therefore breaks it. -/

/-- **Refutation from `S(k)` alone.** If the measured structure factor exceeds `√(k/(2ks))` at some
`k`, then — given Feynman's variational inequality `ε ≤ ε_F` — the dispersion is not Bogoliubov
there. In ⁴He the `S(k)` peak near `2 Å⁻¹` does exceed it, which is the same physics as the
measured `ℓ(k_roton)/(√2ξ) = 0.047`, reached without using the dispersion data. -/
